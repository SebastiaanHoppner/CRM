# CRM
This repository is part of the paper on Cellwise Robust M-Regression (2019) by P. Filzmoser, S. HÃ¶ppner, I. Ortner, S. Serneels and T. Verdonck.

It contains the R package crmReg with the implementation of the Cellwise Robust M-regression (CRM) algorithm and the SPArse DIrections of Maximal Outlyingness (SPADIMO) algorithm. The crmReg package also includes the predict function for fitted CRM regression models, the data preprocessing function used by CRM as well as the function that creates the cellwise heatmaps in the paper. Furthermore, the repository contains the R scripts, as used in the paper, for the simuation study and the application of CRM on the Nutrients data set.
